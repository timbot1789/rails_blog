# README

This is the code for my own personal site where I post blogs and stuff. Over time, I want to expand this to have a variety of different topics and features. Pretty barebones for right now. We only have

1. Viewing multiple blogs
2. Rendering blogs written in markdown into HTML

I expect most of the content here to be backend focused, although I may post some frontend designs from time to time.
