# X4: Foundations Review after 20 hours

## General thoughts:

### Pros:
- Dense, crunchy, complex space sim
- Very cool how you can go from being a single person on a single ship to running an interstellar empire of several fleets and stations
    - At any time you can take control of any ship in your empire and begin piloting it around
    - Or give basically the entire game over to the AI
- You have a lot of freedom in how you want to play. You can play a pirate, a miner, a police officer, or a galactic trucker. It's up to you.
- It can be both an intense dogfighting game, or a laidback trucking game, depending on how you play. 

### Cons
- UI sucks. Barely a step above vanilla dwarf fortress
- No manual explaining core mechanics (where does it talk about salvaging?)
- Ship-to-ship combat, although implemented in detail, is not supported in the core gameplay loop (at least not in early game)
- The UI, even when it works, is just plain ugly. In the mid to late game, management becomes increasingly important, and you spend most of your time on the map screen. And it just looks BAD
- By late game, it's no longer a space simulator, but a spreadsheet simulator.
- Ship designs are ok, but not out-of-this world cool. You rarely get to fly right next to an enemy capital ship to really see its scale. And the best ship designs are mostly ripoffs of Star Wars or Mass Effect

## Who's the game for?
- People who enjoy slow-paced, highly considered decision-making over moment-to-moment action. And people who are willing to put up with a fair amount of friction in exchange for an uncompromisingly open play experience.

## Economic modeling

Perhaps the most impressive part of the game is its fully simulated real-time galactic economy. If a faction wants to build a ship, it first needs to mine the raw materials, ship those raw materials to refineries, take the refined goods to manufacturing plants to make ship parts, then take those ship parts to the ship yard to build the ship. The only things that 'pop into existence' in this game are raw materials and pilots. Everything else must be produced from raw or refined materials. You can even trade these materials in a realtime economy where prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Maybe ore is selling for pennies in the middle of the ore field, but a scarcity in a system on the other side of the galaxy is driving prices through the roof. And this market system is just begging for the player to throw a wrench in. Maybe that scarcity occurred because you destroyed all that system's trade convoys. And you collected all the ore from the burning wreckage, and now you're sitting on it, waiting for the right time to flood the market again. Thi
