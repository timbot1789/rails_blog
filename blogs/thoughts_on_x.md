# X4: Foundations Review after 20 hours

X is a video game series you may only ever hear of if you get deeply enthusiastic about space games. Created by the German developer Egosoft originally as an updated take of _Elite_, it has over the years  carved out a healthy niche among space sim enthusiasts. What's the selling point? Nothing short of a hardcore scifi sandbox on a galactic scale. This is a game where you start as a single nobody in a hunk of junk ship, but slowly, stutteringly, over hundreds of real life hours, you can rise to become the head of an empire dominating the entire galaxy. This game isn't for everyone, but for the people it's built for, it's unlike anything else.

The series tagline is _Trade Fight Build Think_ and this pretty accurately sums up all the things you'll be doing in the game. You take the role of a space pilot exploring the galaxy, trying to make it rich. Maybe you mine for crystals in a nearby asteroid belt. Maybe you haul trade goods from sector to sector, trying to make a good deal. Maybe you take bounties hunting down dangerous pirates. Maybe you become a pirate yourself, raiding unwitting trade convoys and selling off your ill-gotten goods. Whatever you choose, you will be amassing credits, the in-game currency and main form of progression. Much like real life, very little can be done if you don't have cash. Once you get enough credits, you'll upgrade your ship, or buy a new ship, or buy a space station. Then you come up with a plan to get your next new piece, rinse and repeat.

Boy will you be doing this a lot. Not because you're dealing with

## General thoughts:

### Pros:
- Dense, crunchy, complex space sim
- Very cool how you can go from being a single person on a single ship to running an interstellar empire of several fleets and stations
    - At any time you can take control of any ship in your empire and begin piloting it around
    - Or give basically the entire game over to the AI
- You have a lot of freedom in how you want to play. You can play a pirate, a miner, a police officer, or a galactic trucker. It's up to you.
- It can be both an intense dogfighting game, or a laidback trucking game, depending on how you play. 

### Cons
- UI sucks. Barely a step above vanilla dwarf fortress
- No manual explaining core mechanics (where does it talk about salvaging?)
- Ship-to-ship combat, although implemented in detail, is not supported in the core gameplay loop (at least not in early game)
- The UI, even when it works, is just plain ugly. In the mid to late game, management becomes increasingly important, and you spend most of your time on the map screen. And it just looks BAD
- By late game, it's no longer a space simulator, but a spreadsheet simulator.
- Ship designs are ok, but not out-of-this world cool. You rarely get to fly right next to an enemy capital ship to really see its scale. And the best ship designs are mostly ripoffs of Star Wars or Mass Effect

## Who's the game for?
- People who enjoy slow-paced, highly considered decision-making over moment-to-moment action. And people who are willing to put up with a fair amount of friction in exchange for an uncompromisingly open play experience.

## Economic modeling

Perhaps the most impressive part of the game is its fully simulated real-time galactic economy. If a faction wants to build a ship, it first needs to mine the raw materials, ship those raw materials to refineries, take the refined goods to manufacturing plants to make ship parts, then take those ship parts to the ship yard to build the ship. The only things that 'pop into existence' in this game are raw materials and pilots. Everything else must be produced from raw or refined materials. You can even trade these materials in a realtime economy where prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Maybe ore is selling for pennies in the middle of the ore field, but a scarcity in a system on the other side of the galaxy is driving prices through the roof. And this market system is just begging for the player to throw a wrench in. Maybe that scarcity occurred because you destroyed all that system's trade convoys. And you collected all the ore from the burning wreckage, and now you're sitting on it, waiting for the right time to flood the market again.
